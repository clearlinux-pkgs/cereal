cereal - A C++11 header only library for serialization
======================================================
cereal takes arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into different representations,
such as compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON. cereal was designed to be fast, light-weight,
and easy to extend - it has no external dependencies and can be easily bundled with other code
or used standalone.
